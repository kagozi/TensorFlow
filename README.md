# Deep Learning with TensofFlow

> **Note:** All the commands are based on a Unix based system such as _OSX_.
For a different system look for similar commands for it.

## Setup

We are using Python version 3.9.7

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.9.7
```

### Python virtual environment

**Create** a virtual environment:

```bash
$ python -m venv .venv
```

`.venv` is the name of the folder that would contain the virtual environment.

**Activate** the virtual environment:

```bash
$ source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

### Requirements

```bash
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the code
**EACH** subsection is independent while some may be interdependent. Move into each directory and call python for each script:
```bash
$ cd /folder/
$ python3 run.py
```
